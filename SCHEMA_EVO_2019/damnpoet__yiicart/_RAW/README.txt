The project starts with one (1) table at the initial version.
4 hours later, the schema is updated with 109 tables.

We have chosen to omit the initial version from our analysis.
THe reason is the outlier of 109 times expansionRatio of the schema, 
which is by far the largest expansion ratio in the data set 
(the second is 6.5 times enlargment to get an idea).

The rest of the metrics are not significantly affected.
